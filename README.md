# Terraform Examples

This repo contains various examples of using Terraform to deploy Akamai configuration. Each folder is a self-contained collection of TF configs, described below:

- common-settings-module - An example that shows how to implement and manage common settings and config specific overrides across different Akamai properties using a Terraform module

> Note: As the name suggests, these are _examples_ and no support of any kind is offered. Also, when the Akamai Terraform Provider is updated, occasionally changes are introduced which will invalidate something in this repo. Every effort will be made to keep the code here up to date, but there may be slight manual changes required from time to time
